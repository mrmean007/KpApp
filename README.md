# KpApp
The repository contains the source code of android mobile application submited for KP Apps challenge 2015. The app is a potential solution to eliminate the communication gap between the public and the local govt of KPK. It allows users to file complaints with visual evidence. The app communicates all the information including location coordinates, visuals, category of the complaint and information of the user with a server which will be hosted by the govt. The server provides a web interface to show a the complaint markers on google map and allow the admin to assign a tag (pending, in process, completed) to it.
